# Introduction<a id="introduction"></a>
The initial idea was to use a simple Bluetooth headset connected to an antenna to simulate magnetic stripe frequencies. For this, a basic headset was used.

<br><br>
During prototyping, a copper-clad phenolic board was used where, with the help of a pen, I drew the antenna design and marked where the headset and power source would be positioned.

After completing the design, the board was etched with ferric chloride, resulting in something similar to this.

In the initial project, I intended to use a button cell module, but soon realized that this module would not provide the necessary current for the project.

So, I had to adapt a lithium battery connected to a USB Type-C input for charging. I also soldered a selector switch to control when the board is powered on or off. Everything was glued with hot glue; the appearance isnâ€™t great, but it is functional.

To convert the magnetic stripe code into audio that could emulate the same frequency, a Python script was used to convert the stripe information into a .WAV audio file. This file is played in a loop, turning the audio into magnetic information.
<br>
The final result can be seen in the video below where I used my test smartphone running Kali Nethunter on Corvus OS. The communication is instantaneous.
