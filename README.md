# Introduction<a id="introduction"></a>
The initial idea was to use a simple Bluetooth headset connected to an antenna to simulate magnetic stripe frequencies. For this, a basic headset was used.

<br><br>
During prototyping, a copper-clad phenolic board was used where, with the help of a pen, I drew the antenna design and marked where the headset and power source would be positioned.
